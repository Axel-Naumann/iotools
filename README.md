ROOT I/O Benchmarks
===================

This folder contains ROOT I/O benchmark / toy analyses.

Building
--------

In order to build, a recent version of ROOT needs to be in the environment.
For instance loaded from /cvmfs with

    source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_95/x86_64-slc6-gcc8-opt/setup.sh

The Makefile builds the two binaries cms_dimuon and lhcb_opendata.
